[x] when uploading playlist flickers, weird thing with header and rebuild, next frame crap
[x] unseekable files are seekable in UI
[ ] after stopping the seekbar was stuck at 4.999 seconds, starting new file (although not running) the time would remain (session.$.current_time)
[ ] all empties and intertitles stopped working (linux) after something like a weird start, starting with an item with replaced video or something (edl). Very speicifc, cannot figure out what was triggering it. Probably evident in all versions of mpv. Got an mpv log in Downloads. Another time it just went crazy and cycled through the playlist:

[x] uncatchable exception when force quitting + using tree_kill on mpv. No idea. Tried swallowing all errors but no effect.

[x] substitute all ipc stuff with something besides pm2. I want to make pm2 optional, only for managing starting/stopping/restarting processes if they fail.

[x] update_process_infos look into. core.ppid not reliable?
[x] check that streams on termination (stopped by user) are properly handled by nms (no zombies)
[-] fix playlist show scheduled times toggle work with playlists (confusing)
[~] doublclick event playlist item interrupted if first+second click interrupted by rebuild
[x] encoder panel info not showing if empty and loads of 00:00:00 labels 
[~] do init() on page load
[x] switching sessions, the toggle streaming b utton 'disabled' doesnt update very quick, waits until next update from interval. why?
[~] encode crop detect into stream
[x] playlist selection not highlighting newly added files.
[x] update docker config so each module is its own docker thing. FUCK pm2 it's shit.
[?] undefined owner on main
[~] seek flicker every time now :/
[~] file with chapters chapters label abover seekbar disappears when seeking right to end of file (not running) : Making of Hidden.mkv
[~] Access Control interface not updating.
[~] playlist_move from session to session is weird. Just copy?
[x] starting playlist with playlist child first hangs. It loads a null. See The Blue Angel in Session 1, target the top one and observe.
[x] aid evail vid sid extra prop values set after load
[~] detect any props changed by user in GUI. useful (vid, sid, aid, volume, time-pos etc)
[x] show bitrate in stream info (for both session types)
[x] finish up chart update with zoom and bitrate and never clearing etc.
[~] weird, links to external site chrome is still requesting app.css.map and stuff which triggers an auth callback but no cookie present and it shows login! public html stuff really shouldnt be denied, only reason for this is to tirgger a password prompt. figure out a better way.
[ ] [18:40:47.271][w][main][session-1][stream][mpv] [mpv] Source stream 1 (audio) unused and hidden.
    [18:40:47.272][w][main][session-1][stream][mpv] [mpv] Source stream 0 (video) unused and hidden.
    [18:40:47.272][w][main][session-1][stream][mpv] [mpv] Source stream 2 (sub) unused and hidden.
[ ] aid sid vid mpv test thoroughly
[ ] AUTO values for nms player label text show selected value
[ ] fix_2_track_playlist (when creating a 2 track playlist automatically put audio in one column, video in another)
[ ] vid generated from loop file, why isnt it cutting the beginning after seek? restarts. Must be a reason, figure  out why I did it that way or fix it.
[ ] slice at timeline cursor delestt the item apparently if cursor not over the item
[x] check cropping still works and screenshots folder. 
[x] login screen for livestreamer ui
[~] 'Replace Video' does not 'replace video' with video items but changes the background if the media is cropped/padded.
[x] chat is url encoding % in links, screwing them up.
[x] livestreamer seekbar jumpiness after seek has returned
[ ] removing stream target and adding back Local Media Server screwiness. ID is the same confusing the client HLS player. ID should be different.
[x] UI focus/blur textfield try different method (wait for unfocus then update instead of root.update())
[ ] Keep alive media server rtmp streams for 2 mins unless explicitly shutdown by system. Allowing streams to stop/start without starting a new streamtarget
[ ] auto detect crop offset time textbox, auto detect crop its own modal?

[x] GUI target AND a GUI alternative to streaming (a button next to TEST, 'GUI')
    Or if GUI target AND encode target, GUI target must be RTMP based (because it wont display otherwise) <---- DO THIS

[ ] determine when a connection exits cleanly or is disconnected. How long should a live session remain alive after disconnect?
    should be explicitly ended (#EXT-X-ENDLIST) when the user stops stream, not restarting stream targets, but how it works for external sessions not sure?
    if (external) all detected stops are explicit?
[ ] player auto crop / crop was all screwy at first. Double check

[x] main app still issue with nueruc steppy holding down up it flickers as server updates are fed back.
[ ] bizarre nms 480p fuck up...
[x] show live feed /internal/123-123-123-123 in flv player on livestreamer?
[x] ui Precise Volume Adjustment apply disabled not updating fast enough on input change
[x] changing sessions, playlist slight hiccup, number of items chaneg (sub playlists weirdness?)

[ ] configure running stream -> targets shows none, mid changing ids/opts of targets props....
[ ] crop detect is serving sequential frames, not spaced by any time or key frames.
[ ] crop detect fancybox make modalpropertycontainer with padding and title
[ ] crop detect spat out 1 frame?
[ ] recently destroyed sessions
[ ] constrain subs to 4:3 or the original file aspect ratio
[x] live media not getting deleted
[ ] change filename of file, playlist not updating to show red X, unless make a copy
[x] when itme is playing, modify prompted for saving changes when nothing changed first time.
[x] Media Settings panel props disappear when dragging for some reason.
[ ] playlist needs rebuilding more often...
[ ] mpv got stuck... 
        [2426.421][e][ffmpeg] NULL: Invalid NAL unit size (0 > 189).
        [2426.421][e][ffmpeg] NULL: missing picture in access unit with size 193
    and never recovered.
[ ] mediaplayer on setting clip repeats the chapter text is 1 step behind, and the seekbar isnt rebuilt.
[ ] seeking a file video background and subtitles:
    [mpv] EDL: source file '/home/delete/web/cabtv.co.uk/livestreamer/.files/OTH/Solar System playlist.srt' has unknown duration.
[ ] crop input filter is off.
[ ] Apply changes prompt to modals that need require confirmation.
[ ] chat data-pause too frequent, on mobile fullscreen it pauses for no reason.
[ ] mini buttons under chat too packed, no wrap.
[ ] playlist undo messes up media infos
